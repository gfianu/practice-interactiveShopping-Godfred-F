How my code is different from the solution:
My code and the solution both create a functional shopping list, 
but mine uses a slightly different structure and logic. 
I used insertBefore() and removeChild() to swap elements during editing, 
while the solution uses replaceWith() for cleaner element replacement. 
My version names elements and variables differently (addBtn vs. add-button) 
and doesn’t include the feature that lets users press the Enter key to add items. 
I also included a complete and styled interface using an external CSS file, 
while the solution focuses mainly on the core JavaScript functionality without 
additional styling.

What the solution code adds to my learning or understanding:
The solution shows a more streamlined way to handle editing and element replacement, 
which simplifies the code and improves readability. It also introduces a helpful 
usability feature—adding items with the Enter key—which enhances user experience. 
Comparing both versions helped me understand alternative DOM manipulation methods, 
the importance of clean function structure, and how to make form interactions more 
intuitive.
